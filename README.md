IoT Starter Netduino Plus 2 Core
---

<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are tenths BILLIONS of smart devices in the world now, including all sizes of computers, tablets, cell phones, smart watches, pagers, etc. The IoT technology expects to multiply this quantity several times. Then, we expect to arrive soon to an expressive record of a TRILLION devices connected to the Internet. This represents a huge market to be developed in the next few years.

IoT project are quite different than current computing environment, based on human interaction with screens, keyboards and mouses. Instead, IoT should directly handle with nature, processing data in a real time basis. We expect to see from now a lot of new business, probably launched by small and medium companies, managed by high tech teams.
