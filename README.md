IoT Starter Netduino Plus 2 Core
---

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In the world there are tenths billions of  smart devices connected to the Internet right now, including all sizes of computers, tablets, cell phones, smart watches, pagers, etc. The IoT technology expects to double this quantity before 2020, which represents a $6 trillion market to be developed in the next few years.

IoT development challenges us to behave  differently, compared to current  computing environment, based on human interaction with screen, touch, keyboard and mouse. IoT devices should interact directly with nature, processing data in a real time basis. The development process is expected to be more complex and may require the proper tools for developers. Did you consider buying an oscilloscope for debugging?

In order to speed up the IoT development, this article introduces a IoT Starter Kit that may help to speed up an IoT initiative.

<h2>Background</h2>

Supposing you are trying to become an IoT entrepreneur, how to minimize the risks for an IoT initiative? How to satisfy  users, investors and decision makers that support a brilliant "idea" for an IoT project? Some steps may help to reduce the risks:

- Business Plan
- Team
- Methodology
- Proof of Concept
- Starter Kit
- Pilot
- Commercial

Then, suppose that the original "idea" has grown enough to fit in a profitable business plan and it was accepted by investors. After that, an executive manager get involved and gathered a compact developer team, well trained to apply an agile methodology, in order to keep a smooth and continuous workflow. Great! Where are we now? Some time has passed since the investors came in and they are already pushing for results. We should speed up the development process to launch product as soon as possible, they say.

We just started Proof of Concept, when we expect to build the preliminary version that comply with users and investors needs. This is the first version and it should not handle all the complexity required by the final product. The goal is to generate a healthy embryo. Since methodology may evolve the embryo continuously, we can start it small and each version will add functionality and new tests until we have the Pilot prototype.

This is the moment that a Starter Kit may help the team to focus in the main concepts behind the IoT initiative and  make it profitable. Better than that, the resources we got until now - a manager leading a team applying a methodology to generate a smooth workflow, all them are fully operational, immediately after the Starter Kit is installed. 

<h2>Using the code</h2>

<p>A brief description of how to use the article or code. The class names, the methods and properties, any tricks or tips.</p>

<p>Blocks of code should be set as style &quot;Formatted&quot; like this:</p>

<pre lang="C++">
//
// Any source code blocks look like this
//</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember to set the Language of your code snippet using the Language dropdown.</p>

<p>Use the &quot;var&quot; button to to wrap Variable or class names in &lt;code&gt; tags like <code>this</code>.</p>
